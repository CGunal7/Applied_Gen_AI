      "- Last meeting: 2014 Semi-final, Germany won 7-1.\n",

      "- Brazil must overcome a significant H2H deficit of 6 goals and a recent 7-1 thrashing in their last meeting.\n",
      "- Germany must capitalize on their strong head-to-head record and exploit Brazil's defensive vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "⚡ ACTION\n",
      "- Brazil strength: Average of 2.12 goals scored per match (highest in the World Cup).\n",
      "- Germany strength: Strong midfield control, with an average of 1.15 assists per match (highest in the World Cup).\n",
      "- Deciding factor: Germany's ability to limit Brazil's scoring opportunities and capitalize on counter-attacks.\n",

      "- Prediction: Germany 2 - 0 Brazil\n",
      "- Winner: Germany\n",
      "- Reasoning: Germany's strong midfield control and defensive solidity will neutralize Brazil's attacking threat, while their counter-attacking prowess will exploit any Brazilian defensive weaknesses. Brazil's recent form has been inconsistent, and they may struggle to find the back of the net against a well-organized German defense.\n",
